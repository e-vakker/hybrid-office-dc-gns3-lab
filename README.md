# Hybrid Office Data Center GNS3 Lab

---
I have created a GNS3 lab to develop and enhance my system administration skills. My approach is to start with a foundational setup and gradually integrate more advanced technologies.

Initially, I aim to create a small office with reliable core infrastructure and minimal appliances, focusing on essential networking and system administration concepts. I plan to expand it by imitating a data center site and adding a small branch office.
